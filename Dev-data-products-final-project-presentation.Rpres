Introduction
========================================================

- This document briefly describes the Shiny web application used to discover the changes in population of four groups of British wild birds in the period 1975 to 2014. The app can be found on the Shiny server at: [link to shinyapps.io](https://aledevans.shinyapps.io/Coursera-Dev-Data-Products-Final-Project/)

- The data is from 'Wild Bird Populations in the UK' (publsihed by the Uk Government). For the source webapge - including notes on dataset and the dataset for download - click here: [Link to data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/wild_bird_populations/resource/16bcd620-c404-47ed-8cda-5315b24bf0c5)

- Notes for the data processing can be found in the file: uk-bird-data-4-groups.R. This file can be viewed in the github repository for this project: [Link to github](https://github.com/AledEvansUK/Coursera-Dev-Data-Products)



The Application
========================================================

The bird population numbers selected using the 'selectInput' dropdown input.

R code for the plot
========================================================

The barplot is computed with this code: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}

output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
        birdtype = input$birdtype
        barplot(birdData[, birdtype], main = birdtype, ylab="Number of birds - relative to 1970 index value of '100'", xlab="Year", col="gold2", border="white", xaxt = "n")
        axis(side=1, at=c(0, 8, 18, 28, 38, 46), labels=c("1975","1980","1990","2000", "2010", "2015"))
        })

```


Application Installation
========================================================


Download these files from gitub to run the app on your computer:

1. ui.R
2. server.R
3. uk-bird-data-4-groups.R

Save all three files in a new directory. Open the files in RStudio (or another IDE used for R programming). To run the app type the following code into the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(shiny)
runApp()

```
